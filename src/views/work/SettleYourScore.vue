      <p>Leading the web development portion of a large advertising campaign for a company as recognizable as Russell Athletic meant crafting a flawless experience.</p>
      <p>Allowing the client to focus on media to showcase their branding, photos, and videos meant creating a powerful integration with a content management system.</p>

      <h3>#SettleYourScore</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Skipping the pro endorsement deals, Russell Athletic partnered with six high school teams that lost the state championship by a touchdown or less for a season-long campaign to stare down and overcome that loss. Russell partnered with legendary photographer Robert Clark to create six documentaries and partnered with student photographers to create more than 300 pieces of original content that hit the raw emotion of team sports.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>With a brand as well known as Russell Athletic, we knew content had to be king. Tying in with video, social media, and other efforts of a massive advertising campaign, we devised an interactive web experience that showcased photographs and video for the brand and the teams.</p>
      <p>The goal was to convert unwavering team spirit into a rejuvenation of apparel sales. Earning over <strong>240 million media impressions</strong> across several platforms, we ultimately increased year-to-year sales by <strong>180 percent</strong> in the back-to-school period.</p>

      <h3>Crafting an Interactive Web Experience</h3>
      <p>My role in the advertising campaign was technical lead and a vast majority of front- and back-end development. Working closely with and guiding other teammates, the site was built in a tight deadline while managing a small budget.</p>

      <h4>From front to back</h4>
      <p>We crafted a WordPress-powered site with a completely custom front-end. Utilizing Advanced Custom Fields on the backend, content editors were able to curate a large amount of content ahead of time. Utilizing jQuery on the front-end, a customized masonry-style grid of photos and video worked as a portal into interactive content for each team on the front-end.</p>

      <h4>Device-First Approach</h4>
      <p>Knowing that many young users prefer to browse the web and make purchases with mobile devices and tablets, we built the site with extensive dedication to screens of all sizes. Utilizing an in-house CSS framework and accompanying JavaScript feature detection, we made sure to always provide the best experience for every device.</p>
      <p>Quality assurance meant testing on many real devices, ensuring that the experience was of the highest quality and accessible to all. Whether viewing the site on a phone, tablet, or desktop, the experience with <em>Settle Your Score</em> left users with a desire to back their team and purchase apparel.</p>

      <p>I had the pleasure of leading a small team of developers to help this vision come to life. Working closely with designers, video producers, copywriters, and quality assurance team members, we were able to achieve the impossible and launch an amazing rebranding.</p>
      <p>Though the interactive web experience was only one part of the advertising campaign and rebranding effort, it was the gateway to the storefront in which all apparel purchases were made.</p>
